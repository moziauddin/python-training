NOTES:

Series- can be created from any datatype
        it is like a 1 dimentional numpy-array
        vectorized operations can be performed on Series
        Decl: ser1 = Series ...
        Dictionary like

Dataframes:
        2D numpy array
        any data-type
        Decl: df = ...
        rows are labeled using indexes
        Dictionary like

Index:
        What the data is associated with

We can perform the following tasks on data:
        slice
        move column
        math operations
        ref prior rows
        built in moving averages
        standard deviation
        graphing - bar, line, pie, etc

Install the below
udo pip3 install pandas-datareader - For using dataframes
sudo pip3 install pandas - For using pandas
sudo pip3 install matplotlib - For plotting
sudo zypper install python3-tk - For plotting-gui to come up

Use try-pandas/create-sample-csv-data.py to generate sample csv file
